Round 1
MECH BATTLE

Special suits like racing helmets are designed. 

Prototype 1: Racing helmets with comm links, football armor, baseball pads, 10 sensors, basketball material courts. 

Prototype 2: Space-Suit Destroyable, more fragile space helmets, articulated limbs, comm links, boosters, pistons, sensor overloads, 1,000 sensors or else. They try to destroy the suits on each other. Communication systems are connected during the fight. So swearing or cursing. They can debate points. Any points.

Prototype 3: Introduction of Space Weapons
Weapons line an area of the modified "space-king" ring:
a point for every weapon you strike the suit with.

I was there in my "Quantum Reality".

Elon Musk looks to a table and grabs a hunk of Martian rock the size of a melon and strikes Mark across the helmet leaving a gash. There was a hunk of Iron & Cobalt 79 in that rock the Geologists are... Mark gets back up on his feet and he looks towards the table, two Martian Maidens standing behind it, behind the fence, and he reaches for the one they are pointing to... 1000 $ for the electrified AXE.

The favorite weapon in the house right now voted on by the people is the Electrified Axe Modified Light Saber - serious chance of explosion. 50% Still a fan favorite. Elon shakes his victory with the Martian rock, his girls are screaming and pointing to the next fan favorite in the house a block of Moon rock Elon bought back in 2016 and cut from the Moon, Luna himself from robot 1122321  which was controlled by the elemtry school student 12-15-62 and was overseen by the principle and school district 321.123. The rock is pristine and was modified to be used to smash over Mark's face. The inscription on it reads, "Unto Mars Goes This Face, Unto..."

...

They only get a total of 4-10 minutes to destroy these suits in Round 1. If all systems are go, they may complete the entire round, depending on the suit.

...

He grabs it by the handle and jumps at Elon screaming in the microphone about his 1.2% increase in profitorial managerial wage increases at the factory and across the board. And it smashed across his helmet into pieces. Electric flames and plasma explode across the sky in the projector.

The underground Democracy was counting up the votes. For each hit one was taking. Each hit was worth 1 million coins each. I made a coin for this match for sale now at Dog Boy's Secret.
